# 📚 MangaX
*A Dream Project Inspired by MangaDex*

</div>

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

This was an ambitious project aimed at creating a website similar to MangaDex. While the project has been deprecated due to personal circumstances and structural challenges, I've decided to make it public for anyone interested in using or learning from it.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Client Setup
```bash
# Navigate to client directory
cd client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Server Setup
```bash
# Navigate to server directory
cd server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Several folders in this project (admin, translator website) are currently unused
- These were initially planned as separate websites but were discontinued due to:
  - Complexity of maintaining multiple websites
  - Development overhead
  - Resource constraints

## 🦀 About the Rust Code

You might notice some Rust code in the repository. This was part of an initiative to rewrite the backend in Rust. However, the project was discontinued for two main reasons:

1. Lack of comprehensive project structure from the beginning
2. Frequent rewrites due to unstructured development approach

## 📝 Lessons Learned

This project taught valuable lessons about:
- The importance of proper planning before implementation
- The challenges of maintaining multiple codebases
- The need for clear project structure from day one
